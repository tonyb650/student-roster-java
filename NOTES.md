# Notes: Student Roster Assignment

### Description(s)
In this assignment, you will practice many-to-many relationships by building a similar project as the Student Roster 1:n (optional) assignment. Building on what we already had, we will have a way to create classes and a way for students to sign up to classes. Analyze the wireframe below and create the appropriate domain models with the correct relationships.

### Learning Objective(s)

* Extend the Student Roster (1:m) projects to include a many-to-many relationship

### My notes / key take-aways / lingering questions

* Would like to understand RESTful conventions better when you get past the basic "update" route. For example, "changedorm" vs. "adddorm" vs. "removedorm"...are these all PUT and what is the appropriate mapping?
* Solution files used a different approach in a couple cases: using DB queries vs using logic in the controller. But I think my solution is just as good in these cases...not totally sure.
